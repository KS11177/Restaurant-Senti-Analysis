# Restaurant-Senti-Analysis


This project focuses on basic sentiment analysis using machine learning libraries and tools. 
The goal is to analyze textual reviews left by customers of a hypothetical restaurant and assign binary sentiments (positive or negative) to these reviews. 
By processing and evaluating customer feedback, we aim to gain insights into the overall customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
